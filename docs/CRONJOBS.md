# Cronjobs

Cron jobs should be kept in the [cron](cron) folder, the filename for each job should be the interval at which the job should be run (e.g. 3600.php would run every hour).

Please note that these filenames are just for standardisation, you must still manually add each individual script to your crontab at the correct intervals.
